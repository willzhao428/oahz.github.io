I hold an MSc in Information Security from UCL and a BSc in Cyber Security from the University of Warwick. My core interests lie at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity, which led me to complete both the Machine Learning Specialization and the Deep Learning Specialization.

For my MSc dissertation, I investigated concept drift in malware classification, comparing the performance of SVM, Random Forest, and deep learning models across static, dynamic, and hybrid feature sets for Android malware. During my BSc, I developed a proof-of-concept system using BiLSTM and CNN architectures for advanced persistent threat (APT) malware attribution.

Currently, I'm enhancing my practical skills in SOC operations and offensive security by working toward the Hack The Box Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA) and Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certifications.

This collection of writeups showcases CTFs Iâ€™ve completed, with new ones added weekly. Each includes a detailed technical breakdown to reinforce my learning and support others in the cybersecurity community.
